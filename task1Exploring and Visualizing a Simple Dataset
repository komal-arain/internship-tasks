# Task 1 – Iris Dataset Exploration and Visualization

## Objective
The objective of this task is to understand and visualize the Iris dataset using
Python libraries. This helps in learning how to explore data, summarize it, and
analyze relationships between variables.

---

## Dataset
The Iris dataset contains measurements of different iris flowers:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width
- Species

---

## Approach
1. Loaded the dataset using seaborn and pandas  
2. Displayed dataset structure using shape, columns, and head  
3. Created scatter plots, histograms, and box plots  
4. Analyzed relationships and data distribution  

---

## Results
The visualizations show clear differences between flower species.
Petal length and width are strong features for distinguishing between species.

---

## Conclusion
This task demonstrates how data visualization and basic statistics help
in understanding datasets before applying machine learning.
