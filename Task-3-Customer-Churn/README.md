# Task 3 – Bank Customer Churn Prediction

## Objective
The goal of this task is to predict whether a bank customer will leave the bank
based on their personal and financial information.

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer data such as:
- Credit score
- Age
- Balance
- Geography
- Gender
- Salary
- Exited (target variable)

---

## Approach
1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset  
2. Removed unnecessary ID columns  
3. Encoded categorical features (Geography and Gender)  
4. Split data into training and testing sets  
5. Trained a classification model  
6. Evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix  

---

## Results
The model was able to identify customers likely to leave the bank.
Age, balance, and activity status were important factors influencing churn.

---

## Conclusion
This project shows how machine learning can help banks predict customer churn
and take action to improve customer retention.
